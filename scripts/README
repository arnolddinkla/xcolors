A few of the scripts that we use will be included here for the use of making coversions from one term to another.

Note: on aterm and urxvt
    Many people like to use the "aterm*setting" or "URxvt*setting" syntax to separate xrdb themeing for different terminals.  While the format presented in the xcolor_code directory will often work without tweaking, should you wish to split it out in Xresources, you can generate a quick .bak file and then make changes fitting your needs with:

$ sed -i.bak 's/^\*/URxvt./' ~/foo_directory/foo_file

    Which will put the file into a "URxvt.colorX: " format.  Assuming you wish to use aterm's customized format, you could use something along the lines of:


$ sed -i.bak 's/^\*/Aterm\*/' ~/foo_directory/foo_file

    For similar results
